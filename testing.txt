I am not familiar with using github so I'm testing all of:

Stage = Mark files to be included in the next commit
Commit = Save a snapshot of your changes locally with a description
Push = Upload your commits from your PC to GitHub
Pull = Download changes from GitHub to your PC
Clone = Copy a repository from GitHub to your PC (what you just did)
Fetch = Check for updates on GitHub without downloading them
Merge = Combine changes from different sources
